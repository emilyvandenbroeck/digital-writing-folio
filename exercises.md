# Digital Writing
## Exercises
### Week One, Tutorial Reflections
<p>I am trying to romanticise this class. Coding is my to a claim to the identity ✨ Woman in S.T.E.M. ✨. I am ashamed of my Gen Z'edness. Maybe if I delete TikTok I will stop absorbing so much so-called 'brain rot'. Then again, that means I will simply spend more time scrolling Instagram Reels and I sometimes think that may be worse. Anyway, so far, it is kind of a lot. I don't know how I am going to code a whole piece of digital writing and make it look pretty and live up to my perfectionist standards. I suppose the code has to be perfect in order for it to actually work, and ChatGPT can help on that. The creative writing aspect of the experience however, has not got a perceivable perfection--creative works can always be improved upon (maybe) and there is no such thing as perfection (maybe? What about the Mona Lisa or some other iconic, timeless work).

### Week Three, Tutorial Reflections

#### How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

<p>I feel that coding is kind of tricky. I felt that way in week one too. I have respect for people who build whole entire websites because this is crazy. I don't know maybe I am okay. I think I can do this.</p>

#### Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

<p>I never read e-lit in the first place. I cannot fathom how anyone can code a whole entire website. It must take an eternity for people to do such a thing. This is not funny.</p>
