### Week One

<p>As a person of relative youth, I was excited to have the opportunity to write on a digital platform of my own design. Now that I am here, I am questioning my choice. How will I learn this foreign language (code) in just twelve weeks, and submit a developed work up to my own high standards? There is a reason I never pursued visual arts after high school; I do not have the skill set to make my visions come alive for the eyes of others. Another question: what to write that will be suited to the digital platform, and, more precisely, complete in its digital format?!
</p>

#### What do you think digital writing is?

<p>Digital writing creative writing that takes a digital form. It is seperate from that of an e-book in the sense that the experience of this writing cannot be replicated on paper.</p>

#### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

<p>I expect that by the end of the unit, I will have a comprehensive understanding of basic coding and the functions it entails. I, in turn, hope that this will expand my writing practice.!</p>

#### What dypes of writing do you do?

<p>In the majority, I write creative non-fiction pieces—memoir and personal essays. If I do write fiction, it will be heavily inspired by my own life. !</p>

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

<p>I am on and off with journalling/notetaking. I like to use a journal as an archive of observations and experiences to use later for my writing. For a piece I have been working on, called Over My Heart, I have used a collation of journal entries to explore the themes of love, illness, and death.</p>

#### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

<p>The practice of journalling/notetaking allows me to record things with true accuracy. Memory is unreliable, often mistaking the order of events, missing details, or (temporarily, until reminded) erasing a memory completely. Honesty is, to me, my absolute favourite part about writing by others, and I wish to replicate this in my own writing, even when it is difficult or shameful. Journalling/notetaking allows me to revisit the past—to embody once again—whatever I was feeling in that period of time.</p>

#### How do these tools shape the way you write?

<p>In a way, I find that this technique both constrains and facilitate my writing. It acts as a constraint in the sense that, in a non-fiction piece, I cannot lie or alter the events. It facilitates me more though, because it provides to me a plethora of writing content. (In a perhaps unhealthy way, I went through a period of my life in which I made decisions based on the motto "do it for the plot". It caused a lot more emotional and social hardship than it was worth.)</p>

### Week Three, Tutorial Reflections

#### In regard to Nick Monfort poem remix:

#### What aspectes of the remix are the same?

<p>There a words taht repeat, at times, very close the it's last mention, but this could be easily solved by adding more words to the algorithm.</p>

#### What aspects are different?

<p>The content of my poem is very different, as I tried to construct a narrative about academics/writers/researchers.</p>

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

<p>I wouldn't say that this is a successful remix, as some of the nouns indicating place are not properly written out (e.g. coffee should be coffee shop or cafe). This means that at points, the poem does not make sense. I also need to add more words into the algorithm to increase the possible variations of text.</p>

#### Reflection:

#### How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

<p>Coding is a difficult feat. In week one, I really doubted my choice because I had no prior knowledge to the language of coding, and I was unsure how I could learn it within only 12 weeks. I feel now that I could do it, with the help of time, coding forums, and ChatGPT.</p>

#### Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

<p>I never read e-literature in the first place, however, I now feel that there is a whole form of literature that has existed beyond my awareness, that I haven’t considered as something I could draw inspiration from.</p>

#### Questions

##### What is an algorithm? What is a constaint?

<p>An algorithm is a function that uses data to either randomly, or, as directed by code, intentionally present information to the reader or consumer. A constraint limits the possiblities of something like an algorithm, blocking various paths or functions from the reader or consumer.</p>

##### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing?

<p>No, I think that my writing is constantly evolving.</p>

##### Why were Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?

<p>The Oupilo writers were looking for a way in which they could perfect the composition of literature using mathematics.</p>

##### How does algorithmic writing make us think differently about authorship?

<p>It challenges the concept of writing being done in one particular way--can a writer claim authorship if an algorithm aranges their words for them?</p>

### Week Four

<p>Assessment One</p>

### Week Five

#### Toward Assessment Two

##### What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment Two and Three?

<p>I am considering the concept of vanity as a topic for exploration through assessment three. My vision includes a vanity, on which certain areas are clickable and bring up varying musings on vanity.</p>

##### What platform and technology does it require?

<p>The piece will be created using Twine, relying heavily on an image map.</p>

##### Do you know already if you can make it?

<p>I have been successful in inputing images into my twine projects, but have not yet tried to create an image map.</p>

##### What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?

<p>How to create and input a fully functioning image map, which I will do using the resources on the class GitHub page, and ChatGPT for any issues that arise with my code.</p>

### Week Six - 2024 Students' Works, Reflection

<p>Out of the three students works we looked at today--Snow Season, Stay Strong, and House on the Hill--I would say that the first two are those which align most with my practice as a writer, and inspire what I have in mind for my final project. Both projects were made on twine, however the two students, particularly Tanna, who authored Snow Season, utilise Twine in a way that sets it apart from Twine's distinct appearance. Snow Season features photographs in the background of each screen that the reader interacts with, and the text is formatted on the page in a way that is non-conventional--the sentences fall down the page, in a poetic fashion, and certain words are coloured to indicate their function as click-able, bringing the reader to the next 'page' of the story being told.  </p>

### Week Eight - Reflection Post-Presentation

#### What are the themes and ideas your piece is exploring?

<p> On Vanity explores the concept of vanity in a modern context. Through it, I will take the reader on a journey exploring the evolution of our relationship with vanity throughout our lives. The piece will act as an interrogation on what it means to reject vanity when it acts as currency, or if it is even possible when our society holds beauty at such high importance. </p>

#### What literary genre or style are you drawing on? It is narrative drive or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?

<p> On Vanity is a personal essay/memoir with chronological structure split into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, but sub-passages of each life stage which the reader can explore in any order they choose. </p>

#### Succinctly, what is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?

<p>Throughout this piece, I want to convey the barely tolerable weight of societal pressures on young people to conform to beauty standards, and how the desire to reject or throw away the expectations ingrained in our minds is an apparently impossible feat. </p>

#### What do you wish the reader to understand or feel?

<p>I want the readers of On Vanity to recogise themselves in the prose of the piece, to realise how unrealistic beauty standards are, and feel inclined to stop being so harsh on themselves in regards to physical appearance. </p>

#### What drives the reader's momentum throughout the piece?

<p>The movement through the stages of youth, prompted by a 'next stage' button appearing on the passage after the reader has explored all sub-passages of the life stage. </p>

#### How does the digital feed into this momentum?

<p>In the same way that a child cannot wait to grow up, they cannot move to the next life stage without first completing all childhood sub-passages. Nor is there a way to revisit the past, and so previous life stages will be inaccessible after the reader has progressed to the next stage.  </p>

#### How does the literary and digital drive the momentum together with the piece's thematics?

<p>*Read above.</p>

#### Do you need to develop the story/narrative/concept further? How will you do this? By mapping? Writing it out?

<p> I will create a map in which I will write out the content of each passage and where they lead.</p>

### Week Nine

<p>Following the presentation of my proposal, I received feedback from peers on how I can visually intensify my final work throughout the life stages, for example, using a background image underneath an image map to create a sense of clutter or overwhelm with the pressures of vanity. From my teachers, there was the concern with lack of clarity with how the work itself would present itself conceptually through writing, i.e. essayistic, or personal. By incorporating my ideas on vanity, specifically that of vanity related to possession, I will be looking more into my own, personal experiences of vanity and comparison, and how this has intensified throughout my life—something I am sure readers will relate to. 
1.	Complete a draft of the creative writing to be implemented in the digital work. 14/5
2.	Create visuals, i.e. image maps, background images, etc. 25/5
3.	Code image maps and interactive elements 30/5
4.	Edit and implement creative writing by 6/6
</p>

### Week Ten

#### Expectations

##### What were your expectations coming into to the class and what have you learnt?

<p>I don't know what I had expected, maybe something easy like Squarespace or Wix, but I didn't think it would be as challenging as it has been. Coding through Glitch was a huge challenge which we jumped straight into before going into Twine, which may have been easier because it is, or because we already had some background knowledge to coding. I've learnt coding.</p>

##### How has your creative writing practice developed? Are there new directions? Or perhaps it has confirmed something about your practice as it was. 

<p>This class has just re-affirmed my passion for writing creative non-fiction--and probably intensified it too. The ways in which we can experiment and play with format and other media opens up a whole new world of possibility for all writing genres.</p>

##### What particular aspects of code-based writing and E-lit might inform your practice from here on? 

<p>I don't plan on taking my new digital writing skills into my practice from here on, however I feel that a barrier has dissolved, and now my options are less restricted in terms of format for my writing.</p>

#### Reflections

##### Why did you choose this studio?

<p>I chose this studio because it aligned better with my goals as a writer than Comics or Writing off Script. </p>

##### What knowledge did you possess of digital writing/interactive fiction prior to this studio?

<p>Zero knowledge.</p>

##### What were you excited about learning or furthering your knowledge on?

<p>Learning to build a website, specifically, an author website.</p>

##### What were you worried about when joining this studio?

<p>The difficulty of coding, and what falls within the defintion of digital writing. </p>

##### Were there any portions of the class that stood out to you?

<p>Not in particular, I think everything we have learnt has been equally as useful, and expanded my development not only as a writer, but also as a professional. </p>

##### Was there anything you were able to expand your prior knowledge on?

<p>The extend of literature. I did not realise there was a whole world of digital writing out there. My idea of literature was confined to print and e-books. </p>

##### What has inspired your final project?

<p>Past students works, and the Electronic Literature Collection. Also, learning to what extent I am able to work with Twine as a platform for coding, and pushing against its boundary. </p>

##### What knowledge from this studio are you using to create this final project?

<p>Twine use and functions. e.g. image maps.</p>

##### Is interactive fiction something that you will continue to do after this studio?

<p>I do not believe so, although I find assurance in the fact that I have the knowledge and it is therefore an option. </p>

##### Has learning about and experimenting with interactive fiction influenced how you approach writing as a whole?

<p>No, not really. </p>
