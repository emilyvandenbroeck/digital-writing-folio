# Digital Writing
## Exercises
### Week One, Tutorial Reflections
<p>
I am trying to romanticise this class. Coding is my to a claim to the identity ✨ Woman in S.T.E.M. ✨. I am ashamed of my Gen Z'edness. Maybe if I delete TikTok I will stop absorbing so much so-called 'brain rot'. Then again, that means I will simply spend more time scrolling Instagram Reels and I sometimes think that may be worse. Anyway, so far, it is kind of a lot. I don't know how I am going to code a whole piece of digital writing and make it look pretty and live up to my perfectionist standards. I suppose the code has to be perfect in order for it to actually work, and ChatGPT can help on that. The creative writing aspect of the experience however, has not got a perceivable perfection--creative works can always be improved upon (maybe) and there is no such thing as perfection (maybe? What about the Mona Lisa or some other iconic, timeless work).
