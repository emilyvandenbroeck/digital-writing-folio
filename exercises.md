# Digital Writing
## Exercises

### Week One

<p>I am trying to romanticise this class. Coding is my to a claim to the identity Woman in S.T.E.M. I am ashamed of my Gen Z'edness. So far, it is kind of a lot. I don't know how I am going to code a whole piece of digital writing and make it look pretty and live up to my perfectionist standards. I suppose the code has to be perfect in order for it to actually work, and ChatGPT can help on that. The creative writing aspect of the experience however, has not got a perceivable perfection--creative works can always be improved upon (maybe) and there is no such thing as perfection (maybe? What about the Mona Lisa or some other iconic, timeless work).
</p>

#### What do you think digital writing is?

<p>Digital writing creative writing that takes a digital form. It is seperate from that of an e-book in the sense that the experience of this writing cannot be replicated on paper.</p>

#### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

<p>I expect that by the end of the unit, I will have a comprehensive understanding of basic coding and the functions it entails. I also hope that this will expand my writing practice.</p>

#### What dypes of writing do you do?

<p>In the majority, I write creative non-fiction pieces; memoir and personal essays in particular. If I do write fiction, it will be heavily inspired by my own life; autofiction.</p>

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

<p>I am on and off with journalling/note-taking. I like to use a journal as an archive of observations and experiences to use later for my writing. For a piece I have been working on, called over my heart, I have used a collation of journal entries to explore the themes of love, illness, and death. </p>

#### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

<p>The practice of journalling/note-taking allows me to record things with true accuracy. Memory is unreliable, often mistaking the order of events, missing details, or (temporarily, until reminded) erasing a memory completely. Honesty is, to me, my absolute favourite part about writing by others, and I wish to write with honesty always, even when it is difficult or shameful. Journalling/note-taking allows me to revisit the past, and emobdy once again, whatever I was feeling in that period of time.</p>

#### How do these tools shape the way you write?

<p>In a way, I find that this technique both constrains and facilitate my writing. It acts as a constraint in the sense that, in a non-fiction piece, I cannot lie or alter the events. It facilitates me more though, because it provides to me a plethora of writing content. (In a perhaps unhealthy way, I went through a period of my life in which I made decisions based on the motto "do it for the plot". It caused a lot more emotional and social hardship than it was worth.)</p>

### Week Three, Tutorial Reflections

#### In regard to Nick Monfort poem remix:

#### What aspectes of the remix are the same?

<p>There a words taht repeat, at times, very close the it's last mention, but this could be easily solved by adding more words to the algorithm.</p>

#### What aspects are different?

<p>The content of my poem is very different, as I tried to construct a narrative about academics/writers/researchers.</p>

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

<p>I wouldn't say that this is a successful remix, as some of the nouns indicating place are not properly written out (e.g. coffee should be coffee shop or cafe). This means that at points, the poem does not make sense. I also need to add more words into the algorithm to increase the possible variations of text.</p>

#### Reflection:

#### How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

<p>Coding is a really difficult feat--in week one, I really doubted my choice because how was I supposed to create a website from scratch! I feel now that I could do it, with the help of maybe coding forums and ChatGPT.</p>

#### Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

<p>I can't say that there has been a shift in the way that I read e-lit, because I didn't read it in the first place. </p>

#### Questions

##### What is an algorithm? What is a constaint?

<p>An algorithm is a function that uses data to either randomly, or, as directed by code, intentionally present information to the reader or consumer. A constraint limits the possiblities of something like an algorithm, blocking various paths or functions from the reader or consumer.</p>

##### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing?

<p>No, I think that my writing is constantly evolving.</p>

##### Why were Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?

<p>The Oupilo writers were looking for a way in which they could perfect the composition of literature using mathematics.</p>

##### How does algorithmic writing make us think differently about authorship?

<p>It challenges the concept of writing being done in one particular way--can a writer claim authorship if an algorithm aranges their words for them?</p>

### Week Four

<p>Assessment One</p>

### Week Five

### Week Six

#### Toward Assessment Two

##### What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment Two and Three?

<p>I am considering the concept of vanity as a topic for exploration through assessment three. </p>

### Week Six - 2024 Students' Works, Reflection

<p>Out of the three students works we looked at today--Snow Season, Stay Strong, and House on the Hill--I would say that the first two are those which align most with my practice as a writer, and inspire what I have in mind for my final project. Both projects were made on twine, however the two students, particularly Tanna, who authored Snow Season, utilise Twine in a way that sets it apart from Twine's distinct appearance. Snow Season features photographs in the background of each screen that the reader interacts with, and the text is formatted on the page in a way that is non-conventional--the sentences fall down the page, in a poetic fashion, and certain words are coloured to indicate their function as click-able, bringing the reader to the next 'page' of the story being told.  </p>

### Week Eight - Reflection Post-Presentation

#### What are the themes and ideas your piece is exploring?

<p> On Vanity explores the concept of vanity in a modern context. Through it, I will take the reader on a journey exploring the evolution of our relationship with vanity throughout our lives. The piece will act as an interrogation on what it means to reject vanity when it acts as currency, or if it is even possible when our society holds beauty at such high importance. </p>

#### What literary genre or style are you drawing on? It is narrative drive or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?

<p> On Vanity is a personal essay/memoir with chronological structure split into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, but sub-passages of each life stage which the reader can explore in any order they choose. </p>

#### Succinctly, what is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?

<p>Throughout this piece, I want to convey the barely tolerable weight of societal pressures on young people to conform to beauty standards, and how the desire to reject or throw away the expectations ingrained in our minds is an apparently impossible feat. </p>

#### What do you wish the reader to understand or feel?

<p>I want the readers of On Vanity to recogise themselves in the prose of the piece, to realise how unrealistic beauty standards are, and feel inclined to stop being so harsh on themselves in regards to physical appearance. </p>

#### What drives the reader's momentum throughout the piece?

<p>The movement through the stages of youth, prompted by a 'next stage' button appearing on the passage after the reader has explored all sub-passages of the life stage. </p>

#### How does the digital feed into this momentum?

<p>In the same way that a child cannot wait to grow up, they cannot move to the next life stage without first completing all childhood sub-passages. Nor is there a way to revisit the past, and so previous life stages will be inaccessible after the reader has progressed to the next stage.  </p>

#### How does the literary and digital drive the momentum together with the piece's thematics?

<p>*Read above.</p>

#### Do you need to develop the story/narrative/concept further? How will you do this? By mapping? Writing it out?

<p> I will create a map in which I will write out the content of each passage and where they lead.</p>
