# Digital Writing
## Exercises
### Week One, Tutorial Reflections
<p>I am trying to romanticise this class. Coding is my to a claim to the identity ✨ Woman in S.T.E.M. ✨. I am ashamed of my Gen Z'edness. Maybe if I delete TikTok I will stop absorbing so much so-called 'brain rot'. Then again, that means I will simply spend more time scrolling Instagram Reels and I sometimes think that may be worse. Anyway, so far, it is kind of a lot. I don't know how I am going to code a whole piece of digital writing and make it look pretty and live up to my perfectionist standards. I suppose the code has to be perfect in order for it to actually work, and ChatGPT can help on that. The creative writing aspect of the experience however, has not got a perceivable perfection--creative works can always be improved upon (maybe) and there is no such thing as perfection (maybe? What about the Mona Lisa or some other iconic, timeless work).

### Week Three, Tutorial Reflections

#### How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

<p>I feel that coding is kind of tricky. I felt that way in week one too. I have respect for people who build whole entire websites because this is crazy. I don't know maybe I am okay. I think I can do this.</p>

#### Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

<p>I never read e-lit in the first place. I cannot fathom how anyone can code a whole entire website. It must take an eternity for people to do such a thing. This is not funny.</p>

### Week Six - 2024 Students' Works, Reflection

<p>Out of the three students works we looked at today--Snow Season, Stay Strong, and House on the Hill--I would say that the first two are those which align most with my practice as a writer, and inspire what I have in mind for my final project. Both projects were made on twine, however the two students, particularly Tanna, who authored Snow Season, utilise Twine in a way that sets it apart from Twine's distinct appearance. Snow Season features photographs in the background of each screen that the reader interacts with, and the text is formatted on the page in a way that is non-conventional--the sentences fall down the page, in a poetic fashion, and certain words are coloured to indicate their function as click-able, bringing the reader to the next 'page' of the story being told.  </p>

### Week Eight - Reflection Post-Presentation

#### What are the themes and ideas your piece is exploring?

<p> *On Vanity* explores the concept of vanity in a modern context. Through it, I will take the reader on a journey exploring the evolution of our relationship with vanity throughout our lives. The piece will act as an interrogation on what it means to reject vanity when it acts as currency, or if it is even possible when our society holds beauty at such high importance. </p>

#### What literary genre or style are you drawing on? It is narrative drive or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?

<p> _ On Vanity _ is a personal essay/memoir with chronological structure split into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, but sub-passages of each life stage which the reader can explore in any order they choose. </p>

#### Succinctly, what is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
