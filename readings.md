# Digital Writing
## Readings

### Week One

#### 'Frequently Asked Questions about "Hypertext"' by Richard Holeton (ELC Vol. 1)

##### What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

<p>This piece is made a piece of digital writing in the literal sense. It is writing on a digital platform. What makes this different from, say, a Wikipedia page, is not a lot... Except perhaps that it includes a poem at the index/poem page. The piece is navigational via hypertext, while also explaining what hypertext is.</p>

##### Personal Response:

<p>I do not like this piece of digital writing. It strikes me more as informational literature rather than creative, which is always my preference. The poem also makes no sense whatsoever to someone like me, who does not know what the words (?) mean--it uses coding language which I am not familiar with.</p>

#### 'Semantic Disturbances' by Andreas Jacobs (ELC Vol. 2)

##### What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

<p>'Semantic Disturbances' can be considered a piece of digital writing as it utilises both hypertext and text animation. The platform offers the exploration of four different experiences, each with a different 'static-y' images as the background.</p>

##### Personal Response:

<p>I appreciate the aesthetic of this piece of e-literature, however I find that the text animations and lack of narrative or some kind of thread unnappealing. This piece does not compel or inspire me.</p>

#### 'a kiss' by Dan Waber (ELC Vol. 3)

##### What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

<p>'a kiss' is a piece of digital writing as it is interactive, leading the reader through a wide range of three or more choices per screen.</p>

##### Personal Response:

<p>I like the simplicity of 'a kiss'. It follows a narrative and tells it in a poetic way--some passages more poetic than others. The choices the reader is prompted to make invoke a sense of curiosity which, to me, did not occur naturally, before reading each choice.</p>

#### 'novelling' by Will Luers, Hazel Smith, Roger Dean (ELC Vol. 4)

##### What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

<p>'novelling' is defined as a piece of digital writing because it's form cannot be replicated in print. The piece contains not only text, but images and audio as well. Each piece of media has been put into an algorithm which randomised the order and combination of the media--no two readings of 'novelling' are the same. The visual and auditory media are not always occuring in the same combination, nor is the text.</p>

##### Personal Response:

<p>I liked this piece--I think that the text told a narrative true to the life of the average contemporary artist which is relatable to me and those around me. The piece made me feel inspired in the sense that it is a narrative style I would usually read, but in the format of a digital writing piece. It proves to me that digital writing can cover all genres and styles of writing. </p>

The kinetic poem "Taroko Gorge"
The electronic poem "The Gathering Cloud"
The hypertext fiction "First Draft of the Revolution"
The interactive fiction work "Shade"
"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".

### Week Three

#### What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read? 

<p>I pay attention mostly to the words that appear on each screen, but with works like 'Gathering Cloud', my reading will often be distracted by images moving across the screen.</p>

#### How are those elements meaningful?

<p>The images have correspondence to the text that is presented to the reader, and text colour is chosen with purpose. The way that text appears on the page and whether it is standard (left aligned, moving down the page) or random (text boxes in different positions), help to create an atmosphere within the piece, or a sense of disorientation.</p>

### Week Five

#### What do you think of Aarseth's concept? Explain how it offers an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?

<p>I think that Aarseth's concept is focused on how hypertext can give control to the reader in regards to pace, or take that away, as in the work 'Hegirascope', in which it "does not allow for contemplative reading" (p. 6).</p>
